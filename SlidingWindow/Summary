        ## What is Sliding Window Technique ?
        ## Why we need Sliding Window Technique ?

            Window Sliding Technique is a computational technique which
            aims to reduce the use of nested loop and replace it with a single loop, 
            thereby reducing the time complexity.

        ## How to identify Sliding Window Technique ?
            1. Array/Strings
            2. SubArray/SubStrings
            3. Window Size (k)          (Given / Find)
            4. Condition / Calculation. (Fixed / Variable) 


        ## Fixed Vs Variable Size .
